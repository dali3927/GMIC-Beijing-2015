      <p>Imagine being able to buy a theme that had multiple unique designs built right into it. We call these individual designs Stacks, and they provide you with completely unique website designs built into the powerful X theme. Each Stack has its own look and feel allowing you to create virtually any “look” you desire. Next, imagine each Stack was expertly crafted by leading industry professionals adhering to all the best development and business practices so as to not only give you a nice looking site but one that is optimized for performance, search engine visibility, and built with all the latest features and functionality. [extra info="tooltip" title="See what makes our custom Stacks so great!" href="#"]Learn more[/extra].</p>

      <p>Responsive Design is a must in 2013. Having a proper appearance on devices like tablets and smartphone can be important when trying to get new customers or keep your visitors attention. A lot of people only have time to check out things when they are traveling so it makes sense to have your site optimized for every possible kind of device. With X, you can rest assured that no matter what device people access your site from, it will look pixel perfect.</p>

      <p>Choice is king. That’s why you can easily choose between a boxed or fullwidth layout. In the theme options you can change the layout with one click and thanks to the WordPress Customizer you even will see a live preview of how the boxed design looks compared to the full-width one. Don’t forget that this boxed/fullwidth option is available for every Stack built into X.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t matter if you want to only use a solid color, a pattern, or one of your favorite images. X lets you upload or choose a image or color and you will see the changes in the live preview window. Tweak colors and patterns to your hearts content, and when you are happy with the result, simply press save and publish and the changes are live. If you aren’t liking the changes and want to go back to the old styling simply hit cancel.</p>

      <p>Most of the current smartphones and tablets already use Retina displays or better, with the notebook and computer world quickly catching up. To future-proof your website, it is important that your design look good on even the most cutting edge of displays. With custom and icon fonts built into the theme as well as CSS for other stylistic elements like box shadows, rounded corners, containers, and more – the X design is optimized for high resolution displays and will look crisp and sharp on any device. See for yourself!</p>

      <p>Sharing your content on different platforms is getting more and more popular. In addition, having social interaction with your content will increase the exposure Google and other search engines will send your way. That’s why we integrated social sharing in X to get the most out of you when it comes to keep and increase your followers. Enjoy a very customized and tailored approach to social sharing, the X way.</p>

      <p>The Internet has a love-hate relationship with images. The good stuff: they’re beautiful, engaging, and can liven up any post or page by supplementing your content. The bad bits: they’re big, bloated, and slow down your web page (especially on mobile devices). While no perfect solution exists (although many are being proposed and worked on), X does most of the dirty work for you so that you don’t have to worry about this as much. Simply select your layout and how wide you want your content area to be in the Customizer, and X takes care of the rest! X will compute the size of your content area and create perfectly proportioned thumbnails specifically tailored around your options. As web technologies improve, you can rest assured that X will always be using the latest and greatest that is out there to ensure that you and your visitors receive the best (and snappiest) experience on the Internet.</p>
